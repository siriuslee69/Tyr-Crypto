## This file should be imported across all files inside src.
## Only the MetaTag values are meant to be changed. Keep the pragma names as-is.
## Use `metaTags(...)`, not `tags(...)`, because `tags` collides with Nim's
## built-in pragma.
##
## This file is the one every repository copies. Do not write a second
## version of it by hand in a child repository: take this one, change the
## MetaTag list, and leave everything else alone. Otter reads these
## pragmas to draw a repository's statistics, so a repository that
## renames them drops out of every chart.
